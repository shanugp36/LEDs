# LEDs
Different Types of LEDs connected with Different Microprocessors

Oct-2020, 
Here in this repository you can find details about many types of LEDs. 
Mainly we will be talking about simple 3mm, 5mm, 8mm, 10mm LEDs or RGB LEDs with common anode and common cathode.
Wiring RGB LEDs, and the problems while doing so.
Using Arduino how to control these LEDs.
What are the pitfalls. What issues you might come across with Arduino.


Later on, we will talk about 2727SMD, 3535SMD, 5050SMD etc as well.

Then, we will further discuss about Max7219.
